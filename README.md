# Bitaxe Hashrate Benchmark — GUI Edition

A Python-based benchmarking tool with a graphical interface for optimising Bitaxe mining performance. Tests different voltage and frequency combinations while monitoring hashrate, temperature, power efficiency, and **ASIC error rate** — with full support for both **single-chip** (5V barrel jack) and **dual-chip** models (GT 800, GT 801, Duo 650 — 12V XT30).

## Usage

### Launch the GUI

```bash
python BitaxeBenchGui_1_3.py
```

The window opens immediately. No command-line arguments are required.

### GUI walkthrough

#### 1. Connection
Enter the local IP address of your Bitaxe (e.g. `192.168.1.42`).  
Find it in your router's DHCP table or on the AxeOS OLED display.

#### 2. Chip detection
Choose how the tool identifies your hardware:

| Option | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Auto (recommended)** | Works for most devices. Reads `asicCount`, scans all API string fields for board keywords (`gt`, `duo`, `800`, `801`, `650`…), and falls back to a live hashrate heuristic (> 1500 GH/s → dual). |
| **Single chip** | Force 5 V profile if auto-detect picks the wrong mode. |
| **Dual chip** | Force 12 V profile — use this for GT 800/801 and Duo 650 if auto-detect fails. |

#### 3. Starting settings

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial voltage (mV) | 1150 | 1000–1400 | Starting core voltage. The tool increments from here. |
| Initial frequency (MHz) | 500 | 400–1200 | Starting clock frequency. The tool increments from here. |
| PSU max wattage (W) | 60 | 10–500 | Hard ceiling for power draw. Set this to your PSU's rated output. |
| Max chip temp (°C) | 66 | 40–90 | Per-chip cutoff. On dual-chip models the hottest chip is used. |
| Max VR temp (°C) | 86 | 40–110 | Voltage-regulator cutoff. Monitors `vrTemp` and `vrTemp2`. |
| Voltage step (mV) | 20 | 5–100 | How much voltage increases when a combination is unstable. |
| Frequency step (MHz) | 25 | 5–100 | How much frequency increases between stable combinations. |

#### 4. Buttons

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| **↺ Reset** | Restores all fields to factory defaults without clearing the log or stopping a run. |
| **▶ Start Benchmark** | Validates inputs, connects to the Bitaxe, and begins the automated sweep. |
| **📊 Analyse Results** | Opens a file picker — select any benchmark JSON to load the full analysis window. |
| **⏹ Stop Benchmark** | Requests a clean stop after the current sample completes, applies the best settings found so far, and saves results. |
| **🗑 Clear log** | Clears the output panel without affecting the running benchmark. |

## ASIC Error Rate — Why It Matters

> **This is the most important addition in v1.3.**

AxeOS firmware (recent versions) exposes the ASIC error rate on its web dashboard — the same page that shows temperature and voltages. The tool reads this value every sample, averages it per benchmark step, and stores it in the JSON.

### Why naive J/TH is misleading without it

A step running at very low core voltage may appear efficient — low power draw, acceptable hashrate — but the ASIC can be silently dropping a large fraction of nonces. The reported J/TH looks great on paper while the device is effectively wasting a significant portion of its work. Without the error rate you are optimising a ghost metric.

### Error rate thresholds

| Range | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 – 0.19 % | Valid, low | Unusual — check if current is genuinely too low |
| **0.20 – 0.70 %** | **✅ Optimal** | Sweet spot — healthy nonce delivery with minimal loss |
| 0.70 – 1.00 % | Acceptable | Slightly elevated but within tolerance |
| > 1.00 % | ❌ Discarded | Too many lost nonces — J/TH calculation is falsified |

The analysis function automatically **discards** any step with error > 1 % before selecting the best configuration.

### API field detection

The tool tries the following fields in order, using the first one available:

1. `asicErrorRate` — direct percentage (latest AxeOS builds)
2. `rejectRate` — alternative direct field
3. `errorRate` — alternative direct field
4. Calculated: `sharesRejected / (sharesAccepted + sharesRejected) × 100`

If none of these fields are present, the error rate is stored as `null` in the JSON and shown as `—` in the analysis table. Steps with no error data are treated as valid with a warning.

## 📊 Analyse Results Window

Click **📊 Analyse Results** at any time (no benchmark needs to be running) to open a benchmark JSON file and inspect every step.

### What it shows

- **Best configuration card** — prominently displayed at the top with all key values
- **Full step table** — one row per benchmark step, colour-coded:

| Row colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Dark green | Error rate in optimal window (0.20–0.70 %) |
| 🟠 Dark amber | Error rate acceptable but above optimal (0.70–1.00 %) |
| 🔴 Dark red | Error rate > 1 % — discarded from best-step selection |
| ⭐ Gold | The selected best step |
| ⬛ Dark slate | No error rate data in this file |

### How the best step is selected

1. Filter all steps to those with `averageErrorRate ≤ 1.0 %`.
2. Among those, prefer steps where error is in the optimal window (0.20–0.70 %).
3. From the preferred pool, select the step with the **lowest J/TH** (best energy efficiency).
4. If no step falls in the optimal window, fall back to all valid (≤ 1 %) steps.
5. If the JSON contains no error rate data at all, select the best J/TH from all steps with a warning.

The result is a configuration that is genuinely efficient — not just apparently efficient because of dropped nonces.

## How the benchmark works

1. Connects to the Bitaxe API (`/api/system/info`, `/api/system/asic`) and detects the hardware profile.
2. Applies the starting voltage and frequency, then restarts the device and waits **90 seconds** for stabilisation.
3. Runs each combination for **10 minutes**, sampling every **15 seconds** (40 samples total). Each sample reads hashrate, temperature, power, and error rate.
4. Validates that the average hashrate is within **6 %** of the theoretical maximum for the current frequency and core count.
5. If stable → increases frequency by the configured **frequency step**.  
   If unstable → increases voltage by the configured **voltage step**, steps frequency back, and retries.  
   If a safety limit is hit → stops immediately.
6. After all combinations are tested (or a limit is reached), applies the highest-hashrate stable configuration automatically.
7. Saves full results to a JSON file (includes `averageErrorRate` per step when available).

## Safety features

- **Per-chip temperature monitoring** — on dual-chip models, both `temp` and `temp2` are read; the hottest chip is always the limit.
- **Dual VRM monitoring** — reads both `vrTemp` and `vrTemp2`; the hottest is the limit.
- **Profile-aware input voltage check** — single-chip: 4800–5500 mV; dual-chip: 11000–13500 mV. Prevents false alarms on 12 V boards.
- **User-defined PSU wattage limit** — benchmark stops if measured power exceeds your PSU rating.
- **Temperature floor** — readings below 5 °C are rejected as sensor errors.
- **Outlier removal** — 3 highest and 3 lowest hashrate samples are discarded before averaging.
- **Warmup exclusion** — first 6 temperature readings are excluded to avoid cold-start bias.
- **Hashrate sanity check** — if average hashrate deviates more than 6 % from the theoretical value the combination is marked unstable.
- **Graceful stop** — pressing Stop or closing the window applies the best settings found so far before exiting.
- **Dual-chip `asicCount` correction** — if the firmware incorrectly reports `asicCount=1` on a dual-chip board, the tool detects the mismatch and forces the correct value, logging a warning.

## Output

Results are saved to:

```
bitaxe_benchmark_<ip>_<timestamp>.json
```

The JSON contains:

```json
{
  "profile": "Dual-chip (GT 800/801, Duo 650 — 12V XT30)",
  "all_results": [
    {
      "coreVoltage": 1200,
      "frequency": 600,
      "averageHashRate": 2850.4,
      "averageTemperature": 61.2,
      "averageVRTemp": 74.8,
      "efficiencyJTH": 15.3,
      "averageErrorRate": 0.41,
      "profile": "Dual-chip (GT 800/801, Duo 650 — 12V XT30)"
    }
  ],
  "top_performers": [ ... ],
  "most_efficient": [ ... ]
}
```

`averageErrorRate` is the mean ASIC error percentage across all samples for that step. It is `null` (JSON) / `None` (Python) when the firmware does not expose error data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change, then submit a Pull Request against the `main` branch.

If you own a model not yet listed in the supported table, reports of your API response fields (especially `ASICModel`, `boardVersion`, `asicCount`, and the error-rate field name your firmware exposes) are very helpful for improving auto-detection and error-rate reading.
